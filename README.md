Men's Sprint Rules
---------------
> *As defined by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) rules, the first round of competition used 
> to qualify for the sprint competition is the flying 200 m time trial. In this round each rider 
> completes two to three warm up laps and then completes the final 200 m, which is usually just 
> under a lap. The number of riders that qualify for the sprint rounds depends on the competition;
> in World Cup competitions, 16 riders will advance and in a world championship, 24 riders will advance. 
> The top riders are seeded in the following rounds, meaning the fastest qualifier will face the slowest 
> qualifier and so on. Knock-out rounds then proceed, initially on a one race basis and then on a best-of 
> three-race format from the quarter-final stage. Riders defeated in the earlier rounds may get a chance to 
> continue in the competition through the repechage races.*

### Olympic's Specific Rules
> *Matches are contested between two riders who cover three laps of the track. The first rider over the line 
> wins the race, best of three races wins the match. The top 16 riders qualify for the knockout stages with 
> a flying 200-metre time trial.*

Data Limitations
---------------
> While data collecting we experienced some trouble finding some needed data.
Except for 2016, there wasn´t any personal identifier used (i.e. shirt numbering) 
which in 16 is equivalente to **race_id**. Also, some of the time difference 
(**time**) of the athletes that did not make the first place is missing as well. 
So we just replaced the data we did not have by "**NA**" - Not Applicable.

> Curiously, we added the information of the winner of the very first man´s cycling sprint event 
at the 1896 Olympic Games that took place in Greece, for future comparison for assignment 2.2, as baseline data.
